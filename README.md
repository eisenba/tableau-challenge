# Changing BikeShare Ridership during Covid

Ridership patterns in the Citibike program have changed in a number ways in 2020. These changes are likely due to Covid-19 and the public health measures put in place to reduce spread. These changes in ridership, especially in trip duration and age group of riders, point to opportunities to expand ridership to compensate for decrease seen over 2020 and to expand overall ridership post-Covid.

## Overall Ridership

In 2020, monthly ridership decreased compared to 2019 for almost the entire year. January and Febraury had slightly higher ridership in 2020, but April's ridership severely declined. This decline coincides with the institution of public health measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19 including quarentine. Since April, 2020 ridership was slightly below 2019 and followed a similar seasonal trend as 2019. September 2020 was the only month since the institution of public health measures where 2020 ridership exceeded 2019 ridership. While reduced ridership is concern, the continuation of the seasonal trend suggests durability in public interest in the bikeshare program and suggests that ridership could return post-Covid.

## Trip Duration

Monthly average and median trip durations were consistently above average and median trip durations in 2019. Average durations in April, May, June, and July were all above 30 minutes, and median durations were especially high in those same months. The average durations are uniformily much higher than the median durations and peaked in May. These high trip durations may suggest that recreational riding became a larger portion of overall ridership.

## Changes by Age Group

The age distribution of riders completing trips shifted in two major ways. First, there was a large decrease in the number trips completed by 25-50 year olds. This decrease is likely due to reduced trips to and from the workplace. Second, trips completed by 50-55 year olds increased greatly. The large increase in a specific age group suggests that a new group of customers have begun utilizing the rideshare program.

## Changes by Station

The decreases in trips at the Grove St, Hamilton Park, Newport PATH, and Harborside stations account for the majority of the decrease across the program. These stations are near either employment centers or transit assets. These decreases support the conclusion that the ridership decrease is primarily driven by reduced workplace trips. Increases at the Newport Parkway, Columbus Drive / Exchange Place, JC Medical Center, and Liberty Light Rail stations suggest there may be new users or a shift travel demand. These increases along with the increase in trips completed by people in the 50-55 age group suggest opportunities to expand ridership with new users. However the increases at the JC Medical Center and Liberty Light rail stations may be due to changes in travel patterns.
